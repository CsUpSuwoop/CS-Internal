"# CS-Internal"  
1. Worked on code from dates 10/06/22 to 14/06/22, committed code onto github for the 2nd time ever. From the 10th to the 12th I created all my labels, entry boxes and buttons. From the 12th to the 14th I worked on making my functions for my buttons.
2. 14/06/2022 7.30pm - Accidentally deleted committed code file
3. 14/06/2022 7.42pm - Re-commited code file onto github. Continued to build on my print_details function by adding a procedure where all the details that are entered in the entry boxes, print when the print button gets clicked, but if u fill the entry boxes out, then click the append button, then click the print button, nothing gets printed because of no information being in the entry boxes. Added a commented list of changes that need to be made in order to complete my code.
4. 14/06/2022 10.07pm - Deleted commited code file, RE-committed code file on to github. Editted check_inputs function to hide the error messages when the details have been entered into the entry box. 
17/06/2022 between 8.50 am and 10:20am - Editted code so that everytime the code ran, there would be no 'List Index out of range' error messages in the idle shell. I fixed this by changing the value of 'total_entries' from 10 (total_entries = 10) to (total_entries = 0), and by also changing the append_details function for the total_entries variable from (total_entries -= 1) to (total_entries += 1).
