"# CS-Internal"  
1. Worked on code from dates 10/06/22 to 14/06/22, committed code onto github for the 2nd time ever. From the 10th to the 12th I created all my labels, entry boxes and buttons. From the 12th to the 14th I worked on making my functions for my buttons.
2. 14/06/2022 7.30pm - Accidentally deleted committed code file
3. 14/06/2022 7.42pm - Re-commited code file onto github. Continued to build on my print_details function by adding a procedure where all the details that are entered in the entry boxes, print when the print button gets clicked, but if u fill the entry boxes out, then click the append button, then click the print button, nothing gets printed because of no information being in the entry boxes. Added a commented list of changes that need to be made in order to complete my code.
4. 14/06/2022 10.07pm - Deleted commited code file, RE-committed code file on to github. Editted check_inputs function to hide the error messages when the details have been entered into the entry box.
5. 17/06/2022 between 8.50 am and 10:20am - Editted code so that everytime the code ran, there would be no 'List Index out of range' error messages in the idle shell. I fixed this by changing the value of 'total_entries' from 10 (total_entries = 10) to (total_entries = 0), and by also changing the append_details function for the total_entries variable from (total_entries -= 1) to (total_entries += 1). 
6. 20/06/2022 6.45pm to 7.20pm - Worked on setting up delete row function, first changed all the 'main_window's to 'root', then globalled my 'total_entries' variable and 'name_count' variable and then changed the last command in line 84 'print_customer_details' to my actual function that prints all the details called 'print_details'. 
7. 22/06/2022 3.46pm - Completed coding for delete row function, and the delete row function is now fully functional.
8. 24/06/2022 4.30pm - Found out that my check inputs function did not completly work. Even if the requiremnts were not being met, the details would still get appended and printed, so I added on to the function where, the details would only append and print, if the detail requirements were met. Also added a feature where the user cannot enter a letter into the reciept number, if there is a letter in the reciept number, an error message pops up, and all none of the details will be able to be appended or printed.
9. 25/06/22 2.50pm - Added details, like file creation date and the author's name in comments, and also a to-do list in order for my code to be completed.
